### Hello there my name is Juan. Nice to meet you 👋

My long-term goal is to build my career as a FPGA Engineer. I'm currently at [NAWCWD](https://www.navair.navy.mil/nawcwd/), where I specialize in designing and implementing hardware solutions. I'm fascinated by the challenge of architecting systems at the lowest level, visualizing data as a fluid and carving the digital landscape into a system of rivers.

To expand my expertise, I'm actively building skills in adjacent disciplines like Linux System Programming, Digital Signal Processing, and RF Engineering. My passion lies in perfecting my personal workflow—automating repetitive tasks, creating seamless workspace transitions, and eliminating friction in my development process. I believe that a deep mastery of Linux, networking, and system-level knowledge is the key to building the ultimate, location-independent development environment.
